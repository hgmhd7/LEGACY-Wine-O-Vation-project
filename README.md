### Wine Machine Learning

This is a machine learning project to predict the score of a wine based on reduced set of variables.

The data was scraped from [Wine Enthusiast](http://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine)

We started with 14 columns and 130k rows. The features were country, points, a description, a designation, price, province, region1, region2, the taster name, the taster twitter handle, wine name, variety and winery. We reduced the features down using machine learning to predict the points as a target variable.
